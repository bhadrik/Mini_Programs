ccpp stand for .c and .cpp file compiletion. It is a c program to make normal gcc command litel bit faster.
e.g. if i want to compile file named file.c then normal command : gcc -o file file.c, ccpp command : ccpp file.c/file.cpp here it will generate file/file.exe named executable file. If we use gcc -o file.c/file.cpp it will compile and run the output file also.
